# monday.com for Cursor

**Cursor-optimized monday.com integration** with smart code context awareness.

**Requires:** Standard monday.com tools (MCP server or API access) - works with any integration providing `monday_create_board`, `monday_create_item`, etc.

**Code-First Workflow:** Analyze current file/project → Create relevant monday.com boards → Sync development progress.

## Cursor-Specific Behaviors

**🔍 Context Awareness:**
- Detect project type from files (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Create appropriate board templates for detected stack
- Map repository structure to monday.com workspace organization

**📋 Smart Board Creation:**
- **Frontend projects** → UI/UX boards with design, development, testing groups
- **Backend APIs** → Endpoint boards with planning, implementation, documentation groups
- **Full-stack** → Comprehensive project boards with frontend, backend, deployment groups

**🔄 Code Integration:**
- Convert TODO comments to monday.com items
- Link GitHub issues to monday.com tasks
- Update task status based on commit messages
- Create sprint boards from milestone planning

## Quick Commands

**Auto-detect and create board:**
```
> Detected React project with TypeScript
> Created **Frontend Sprint Board** in Development workspace
> Added items from 12 TODO comments
> → [Open board](https://acme.monday.com/boards/123456)
```

**Sync current work:**
```
> Synced current branch 'feature/user-auth' with monday.com
> Updated 3 items: Login Component, Auth Service, Tests
> → [View progress](https://acme.monday.com/boards/123456)
```

## File-Based Triggers

**When editing these files, auto-suggest monday.com actions:**
- `package.json` → Offer to create project board
- `README.md` → Offer to create documentation board
- `CHANGELOG.md` → Offer to sync releases with monday.com
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` → Offer to create CI/CD tracking board

## Project Templates

**React/Frontend:**
- Groups: Design, Components, Pages, Testing, Deployment
- Columns: Status, Developer, Complexity, Due Date, Preview Link

**Node.js/Backend:**
- Groups: Planning, Endpoints, Database, Testing, Documentation
- Columns: Status, Developer, Story Points, Priority, Endpoint URL

**Full-Stack:**
- Groups: Planning, Frontend, Backend, Integration, Deployment
- Columns: Status, Team Member, Sprint, Complexity, Dependencies

## Integration Patterns

**File Changes → monday.com Updates:**
```
// TODO: Add user authentication
// → Creates item "Implement user authentication" in current sprint
```

**Commit Messages → Status Updates:**
```
git commit -m "feat: user login component complete"
// → Updates "User login component" status to "Done"
```

**Branch Names → Board Organization:**
```
feature/user-dashboard → Links to "User Dashboard" epic in monday.com
bugfix/login-timeout → Updates bug tracker board
```
